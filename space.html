                <h2>ðŸš€ Chandrayaan-1: India's First Mission to the Moon (2008)</h2>
                <p>Chandrayaan-1 was India's first-ever lunar mission and a major milestone in the history of Indian
                    space exploration. Launched on 22 October 2008 by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), the
                    mission marked India's entry into the elite club of nations capable of deep space exploration. The
                    mission was launched from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota using the Polar Satellite
                    Launch Vehicle (PSLV-C11). Its main objective was to orbit the Moon and gather data about its
                    surface, mineral composition, and topography.
                    Chandrayaan-1 was an orbiter mission, meaning it did not land on the Moon. Instead, it carried a
                    suite of 11 scientific instruments from various international space agencies including NASA, ESA
                    (European Space Agency), and Bulgaria, along with five instruments developed by Indian scientists.
                    The mission's most remarkable achievement came when the Moon Impact Probe (MIP), one of the mission
                    components, was intentionally crashed onto the lunar surface. </p>

                <h2>ðŸŒ” Chandrayaan-2: Attempt to Soft-Land on the Moon (2019)</h2>
                <p>Chandrayaan-2 was India's second lunar mission and one of the most ambitious projects undertaken by
                    the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). It was launched on 22 July 2019 from the Satish
                    Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota using the powerful GSLV Mk III-M1 rocket, India's most advanced
                    launch vehicle at the time. Building upon the success of Chandrayaan-1, this mission aimed not just
                    to orbit the Moon but also to soft-land a lander and deploy a rover, a complex and
                    never-before-attempted feat by India.</p>
                The Chandrayaan-2 spacecraft consisted of three components: the Orbiter, the Lander (named Vikram), and
                the Rover (named Pragyan). The orbiter was equipped with advanced scientific instruments to map the
                lunar surface and analyze the exosphere. It was designed to function for one year but is still
                operational and continues to send back valuable scientific data. The lander, Vikram, was designed to
                make a gentle descent onto the Moon's surface near the south polar region, a place no other mission had
                targeted before. Once landed, the Pragyan rover was expected to roll out and analyze soil composition,
                conduct elemental analysis, and study the lunar surface.</p>

                <h2>ðŸŒ– Chandrayaan-3: India's Historic Soft Landing (2023)</h2>
                <p>Chandrayaan-3 stands as a monumental achievement in India's space history, marking the country's
                    first successful soft landing on the Moon. Launched on 14 July 2023 by the Indian Space Research
                    Organisation (ISRO) using the trusted LVM3-M4 rocket, Chandrayaan-3 became a globally celebrated
                    mission when it successfully landed near the Moon's south pole on 23 August 2023. With this
                    achievement, India became the first country to land near the Moon's south pole and the fourth
                    country in the worldâ€”after the USA, Russia, and Chinaâ€”to perform a soft landing on the lunar
                    surface. This mission was a direct follow-up to Chandrayaan-2, designed to fix the issues from the
                    previous attempt and prove India's ability to land safely on another celestial body.</p>
                <p>Unlike Chandrayaan-2, Chandrayaan-3 was a simplified mission with just two components: a lander named
                    Vikram and a rover named Pragyan. It did not include an orbiter, as the still-functioning orbiter
                    from Chandrayaan-2 was used for communication and observation. The lander was equipped with improved
                    guidance, navigation, and control systems to ensure a safe landing, even in challenging terrain. The
                    mission focused on demonstrating critical technologies for safe landing, such as altitude sensors,
                    hazard detection systems, and throttleable engines.</p>
